# Samuel-O-Blenes-NE-111-Curve-Fitting-Project
This is my final project for the NE 111 Introduction to Programming for Engineers course. The project features a user-friendly GUI built with Streamlit, allowing users to input data manually or upload CSV files. It supports fitting several types of statistical distributions, including normal, gamma, Weibull, and various other distributions.
